**About Me**

I am a recent High School graduate from Nepal who loves bringing ideas to life. I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Data Analyst, and and a Web/App Developer.

Apart from Data Science and Machine Learning, I am also passionate about HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and have worked on two HCI projects ([Saas](https://projectsaas.info) and [SeeingBox](https://github.com/dhaydoo/SeeingBox)) related to Healthcare and Blind Assistance respectively.

I am currently a Data Science Fellow at [Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/) and Deep Learning Researcher at [Learn by Research](https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch).

Previously, I have also worked as Data Research Analyst and Machine Learning Developer during my fellowship at [Incubate Nepal](https://incubatenepal.com/), where I worked with Georgetown, Yale, and MIT graduates to contribute in 3 of the 6 projects for that year ([Project Apravasi](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgnopvSoLP9/), [Project Saas](https://projectsaas.info/), and [Project Sanjal](https://nsuman.github.io/SanzalWeb)).
