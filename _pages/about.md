## About Me

I am a High School graduate from Nepal who loves bringing ideas to life. I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Data Analyst, and an amateur Web/App Developer.

I am currently a Data Science Fellow at Code for Nepal and Deep Learning Researcher at Learn by Research.

Previously, I have worked as a Data Research Analyst and Machine Learning Developer at [Incubate Nepal](https://incubatenepal.com/), where I worked with Georgetown, Yale, and MIT graduates to contribute in 3 of the 6 projects for that year ([Project Apravasi](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgnopvSoLP9/), [Project Saas](https://projectsaas.info/), and [Project Sanjal](https://nsuman.github.io/SanzalWeb)).

Apart from Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Web Development, I am also passionate about Human-Computer Interaction and have worked on 2 HCI projects ([Saas](https://projectsaas.info) and [SeeingBox](https://github.com/dhaydoo/SeeingBox)) aimed for Healthcare and Blind Assistance respectively.
